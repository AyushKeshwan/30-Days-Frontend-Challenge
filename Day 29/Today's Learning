üöÄ Day 28 of my 30-day challenge update! üåê

Today, I embarked on the exciting journey of learning the backend part of the MERN stack, which involves Node.js and Express.js. Here are a few key takeaways from my exploration:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Node.js: It's a powerful JavaScript runtime environment that allows us to run JavaScript code on the server-side. With its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, Node.js enables efficient and scalable backend development.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Express.js: It's a fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js. Express.js simplifies the process of building robust and scalable APIs, handling routing, middleware integration, and more. Its flexibility and extensive ecosystem make it a popular choice for web developers.

3Ô∏è‚É£ EJS: EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a templating engine that allows us to generate dynamic HTML content on the server-side. With EJS, we can easily integrate server-side logic and dynamically render HTML templates based on data.

By expanding my skills into the backend realm, I'm equipping myself with a comprehensive understanding of the MERN stack. This will enable me to develop full-stack applications and provide end-to-end solutions.

Stay tuned for more updates as I dive deeper into backend development and explore the wonders of combining frontend and backend technologies! üíª
