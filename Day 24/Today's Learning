 Day 24 of my 30-day challenge: Today, I dived into the world of React hooks and explored the useRef hook. üé£ To solidify my understanding, I built a simple BMI calculator app using React, useState, and useRef hooks. With the useRef hook, I discovered its usefulness in accessing and managing DOM elements. Here are a few key takeaways:
1Ô∏è‚É£ useRef allows us to reference and interact with DOM elements directly.
2Ô∏è‚É£ It can be used to store mutable values across re-renders without triggering a re-render.
3Ô∏è‚É£ useRef is especially handy for handling focus, capturing previous values, or integrating with third-party libraries.

Additionally, I started exploring React Router DOM and single-page applications (SPA) concepts. Excited to apply these new learnings in more projects!
