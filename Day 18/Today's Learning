Today, I embarked on an exciting project - creating a movie search application. Leveraging my JavaScript promises knowledge and honing my HTML/CSS skills, I took the first steps towards bringing this idea to life. Stay tuned as I unveil the complete application tomorrow!

In addition, I refreshed my Webflow knowledge by diving into their crash course. By completing over 50% of the course, I've enhanced my web design skills and gained a deeper understanding of this powerful tool.

Thrilled to continue pushing my boundaries and creating impactful projects. Stay tuned for more updates!
