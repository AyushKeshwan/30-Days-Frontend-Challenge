ðŸŽ¥ Day 19 of my 30-day challenge: Lights, Camera, Action!

Today, I made great progress on my movie search application! ðŸŽ¬ Now, users can explore and find details about movies. While I focused on making it work smoothly, I feel there's more to be done to make it look even better. I'll be working on the design tomorrow to improve the overall experience.

Creating this app has been a thrilling and exciting journey. It's incredible how coding brings ideas to life! Stay tuned for the finishing touches as I aim for perfection.
