Excited to announce the completion of my movie searching app today!

This app utilizes the powerful OMDb API to fetch all the essential details about your favorite movies.

During development, I focused on enhancing the user interface, making it more visually appealing and intuitive. I've also implemented an error message page that gracefully handles cases when the API doesn't find a particular movie.

To make searching even more convenient, I added a keypress event listener, allowing users to hit the "Enter" key to initiate the search.

While the app's responsiveness is currently a work in progress, rest assured that I'm committed to making it fully responsive in the upcoming days.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue refining this movie searching app! üé•üçø #30DayCodingChallenge #MovieSearchApp
