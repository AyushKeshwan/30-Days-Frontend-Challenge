Day 26 of my 30-day challenge: Today, I dedicated time to revise the fundamental hooks in React and deepened my understanding of the useState and useRef hooks. They are powerful tools that allow me to manage state and access DOM elements with ease.

In addition, I explored the useEffect hook, which enables me to perform side effects in React components. Here are a few key points about the useEffect hook:
1Ô∏è‚É£ It allows me to handle side effects, such as fetching data from an API, subscribing to event listeners, or updating the document title.
2Ô∏è‚É£ The useEffect hook takes a callback function that executes after every render cycle.
3Ô∏è‚É£ By specifying dependencies, I can control when the effect runs, optimizing performance and preventing unnecessary re-renders.

The useEffect hook opens up new possibilities for managing component lifecycles and integrating with external resources. 
I'm excited to apply this knowledge in my upcoming projects! üí°üöÄ #reacthooks #useeffect #frontenddevelopment #webdevelopment
