📝 Day 29 of my 30-day coding challenge update! 🎨

Today, I decided to take a break from coding and focused on honing my web design skills. I created some stunning designs, experimenting with different layouts, color schemes, and typography.

In addition, I started working on a blog to document my entire coding journey. I'm excited to share my experiences, lessons learned, and insights gained during these 30 days. Stay tuned for its release!

I believe that combining coding and design skills will make me a well-rounded professional in the field. Looking forward to showcasing some of my web designs and continuing this amazing learning journey!
